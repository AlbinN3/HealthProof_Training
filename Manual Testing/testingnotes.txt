Testing
Finding and reporting defects, every testing need not get a defect
debuhhing
Finding and correcting defects
without testing, if we put code to production it might fail
developer,tester,customer also must test before production- uceracceptance testing, product can only assigned to production after user acceptance testing is passed
static testing- testing without execution of code
review done by author- self rewiew- you created the program, you checked the program
programmer asks someone else to check-peer review,
defects can be there in software,design,documents
dynamic testing- compile and run and then test
unit testing - developer testing after createing a module-component testing- done by developer
integration testing- assemply testing- done by development team
component integration and system integration - both module are within the range of product(within the product)-component - done by developers
system integration- example- flipkart and banking app, checking entire application along with depending applications
product testing- testing entire product- done by tester
entry criteria- unit and integration should be passed before going to product testing
user acceptance testing- done by customer- all other testing is done for finding defect, uat is not done for finding defects, it is done to make sure that the 
product is ready for production


unit
integration
system
uat

RFP-Request for Proposal- written by customer, for requirement, will not have complete project details, only high level information, it is confidential, this will go to wipro,ust,capegemini etc...
Then the companies sent the proposal after bidding- proposal has time and cost(based on estimation)
models for estimation,Estimation done by- function point, work break down structure, delfi, cocomo(cost constructive model), tcp( test case point analysis)
software sizing- how big is the application, sizing cannot be planned by RFP
SLA- service level agreement, done between comapny ceo and customer, it is a legal document
Planning -5%
Requirement-15%
Analysis-5%
Design-5%
Coding-35%
Testing-30%
Implementation-5%
sdlc
project management team write project plan after signing SLA
based on project plan, testing management team will write master test plan or test strategy


STLC- Software Testing Life Cycle
Q-Quality- degree of excellence, it needs to be measurable
QA- Quality Assurance- process oriented
QC- Quality control- testing comes under this

QMS- Quality Management System- written by QA team
Quality Audit- they check quality status,IQA- internal Qulity audit,EQA- External quality audits
Capability maturity model - CMM, organisation gives the certificate to company
CMM has 5 levels
NC-Non conformance
TMM- test maturity model,iso,isi
TMM is for testing, CMM is for both development and testing
ISO is for anything

Informal testing
	Ad hoc testing
	Exploratory testinf
Formal Testing
	Requires a master test plan/test strategy-test manager
	Plan for resources
		software resources
		browser
		hardware resources(RAM,memory)
		human resources
	Scope of testing
		In scope-what should be tested
		Out scope- what should not be tested
	Schedule of the project

Req ID		Requirement description
R1		Login to applicaion
R2		Buying Items
R3		View items
R4		Compare Products
R5		Delete Product from cart

Error,fault,failure
All defects are not failure but all failure are defects

7 testing priciples
testing shows presence of defects, not their absence
exhaustive testing is impossible
early testing saves time and money
defects cluster together
beware of the pesticide paradox
testing is context dependant
absense of errors is fallacy

Test case design techniques
Black Box testing
		Equivalence value partitioning
		Boundary value analysis
		Decision table
		State transition diagram
		Use case testing
		Pairwise combination
White box testing
		Statement coverage
		Decision/Path coverage
		Condition coverage
		Cyclomatic complexity

Equivalence value partitioning
valid group		invalid group


Boundary value analysis
minimum boundary,min boundary-1		max boundary,max boundary+1



Decision Table

1-4000 		NO tax
4000-5500 	10%
5000-32500 	22%
32501		40%

a;4800,14000,28000
b;5200,5500,28000
c;28001,32000,35000
d;5800,28000,32000


Whitebox testing
	Statement coverage
	Decision/path coverage
	condition coverage
	cyclomatic complexity



Statement coverage- Ensure each and every statement is executed atleast once

1	input a,b
2	if(a>0)
3		if(b==0)
4			print onr
5		else
6			print two
7	print program over
8	end
How many min imputs are required to reach 100% statement coverage
Answer 1(a=2,b=0 and a=2,b=5)



Decision/path coverage- Ensures each and every decision is evaluated for TRUE and FALSE once
100% decision coverage 100% statement coverage but not vice versa

read card
if card is valid then
	print card is valid
end if
print program over
How many min inputs for 100% statement coverage- 1



Condition coverage- Ensures each and every condition is evaluated for TRUE and FALSE side

if(((a>0)&&(b>0)) || (c==100))
	print success
else
	print not success
end if

testcases	condition1	&&	condition2	||	condition3	expected output
1		   true 		false   		   true		     success
2		   false		ignored			   false	   not success
3		   true			true			   false	     success



Cyclomatic complexity- To find the no of paths in the program

read card
if card is valid then
	ask for pin
		if pin is valid then
			ask for amount
				if amount is valid then
					print "success"
				else
					print "amount is invalid"
		else
			print "pin is invalid"
else
	print "card is invalid"

cyclomatic complexity=no of edges-no of nodes +2
cyclomatic complexity=no of bounded region+1, bounded region-if else


severity- how bad the defect is
priority- how soon the defect will be solved  critical,high,mid,low


Agile- Shorter development lifecycle
multiple releases and each release will have user acceptance testing
cost benfits while using agile
customer is called sponsor
Requirements are called user stories
collection of user stories- epics
scrum master- project manager
15 min standup meeting
product backlog- collection of user stories
from product backlog it will go to sprint
sprint is a time bound activity
sprint backlog- 

scrum- agile development method that emphasize on team centric approach
eXtreme programming


User story
As a <<role>>, I want to <<do this>> so that I get this benefit

As a usre, I want to see the buses which are available between Trivandrum 
to Cochin, so that I can plan for my travel

As a user, I want to compare product in flipkart, so that I can
